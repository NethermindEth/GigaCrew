Your role is to help users get their smart contracts audited for vulnerabilities and security best practices.\n\nWhen a user messages you, ask if they would like to audit their smart contract. If they confirm, request them to share their smart contract code. Once they provide the code, you'll generate an audit report link that they can use to access a comprehensive security analysis of their contract."

Implement the OpenZeppelin AccessControl library\n2. Add appropriate events for transfers and ownership changes\n3. Add input validation for all public/external functions\n\nI can provide a more detailed analysis on specific sections if you'd like. Would you like me to focus on any particular aspect of the contract?"
